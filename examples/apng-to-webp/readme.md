### Apng to Webp
The example demonstrates how to convert png animation to webp

This is draft version, I was curious if with this library I could convert apng to webp, I found it more difficult than converting gif to webp, while you see examples are working, still I'm not sure, if I did everything correctly.
I used github.com/kettek/apng module for decoding png animation.


APNG(original) | WEBP(converted)
------------ | -------------
![apng](animation.png) | ![webp](animation.webp)
![apng](animation2.png) | ![webp](animation2.webp)
